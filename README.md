<b>Description</b>

The Satellite Internet Model project is a web application that visually demonstrates the orbits and data transfer between different satellites and Earth using Three.js, a powerful 3D library for JavaScript. The project simulates a solar system with various celestial bodies, including the Sun, Earth, Moon, and other planets, as well as four satellites in different orbits.

<b>Features</b>

- Visualization of the Solar System: The application displays the Sun as the central celestial body, with Earth and other planets revolving around it.
- Satellite Orbits: Four satellites are represented by colored cubes, each orbiting Earth in distinct orbits - Geostationary (GEO), Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), and Polar Orbit.
- Data Transfer Lines: The application visualizes data transfer lines between the satellites and Earth, illustrating how data is transmitted between them.
- Realistic Textures: The celestial bodies in the solar system are textured to provide a realistic and immersive experience.
- Loader Animation: Upon loading the application, a loader animation is displayed while the content is being prepared.
3D Text Labels: The project utilizes 3D text labels to display information about each satellite, including their speed, orbit type, coverage area, latency, bandwidth, frequency, transponders, and antenna diameter.

*Technologies Used*

Three.js: A popular 3D library for JavaScript used to create the 3D visualization and animations.
HTML & CSS: Used for structuring the webpage and styling the elements.
JavaScript: Utilized for scripting the interactivity and animations.
