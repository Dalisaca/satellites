<h2>Description</h2>

The Satellite Internet Model project is a web application that visually demonstrates the orbits and data transfer between different satellites and Earth using Three.js, a powerful 3D library for JavaScript. The project simulates a solar system with various celestial bodies, including the Sun, Earth, Moon, and other planets, as well as four satellites in different orbits.

<h2>Features</h2>

* Visualization of the Solar System: The application displays the Sun as the central celestial body, with Earth and other planets revolving around it.
* Satellite Orbits: Four satellites are represented by colored cubes, each orbiting Earth in distinct orbits - Geostationary (GEO), Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), and Polar Orbit.
* Data Transfer Lines: The application visualizes data transfer lines between the satellites and Earth, illustrating how data is transmitted between them.
* Realistic Textures: The celestial bodies in the solar system are textured to provide a realistic and immersive experience.
* Loader Animation: Upon loading the application, a loader animation is displayed while the content is being prepared.
* 3D Text Labels: The project utilizes 3D text labels to display information about each satellite, including their speed, orbit type, coverage area, latency, bandwidth, frequency, transponders, and antenna diameter.

<h2>How to Use</h2>

1. Visit the <a href="https://thriving-arithmetic-77f11d.netlify.app/">live demo</a> to interact with the application or clone this repository and run the project on your local machine.
2. Wait for the loader animation to finish, and the celestial bodies will be displayed.
3. Explore the Solar System: Use your mouse to rotate the camera and zoom in/out using the scroll wheel.
4. Observe Satellite Orbits: Observe the four satellites orbiting Earth in different paths.
5. Data Transfer Visualization: Watch the data transfer lines between the satellites and Earth.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

* Three.js: A popular 3D library for JavaScript used to create 3D visualization and animations.
HTML & CSS: Used for structuring the webpage and styling the elements.
* JavaScript: Utilized for scripting interactivity and animations.
